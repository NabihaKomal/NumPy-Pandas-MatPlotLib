# NumPy-Pandas-MatPlotLib
Projects from the Udacity Nanodegree AI Programming with Python in the form of Jupyter Notebooks . 
The [first notebook]((https://github.com/fotisk07/NumPy-Pandas-MatPlotLib/blob/master/) uses NumPy to perform mean normalization.
The [Second notebook]((https://github.com/fotisk07/NumPy-Pandas-MatPlotLib/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING) uses Pandas to extract useful information concerning Apple, Amazon, and Google stocks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The Code inside the nptebooks is written in Python 3.6.5 . If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. 

To install pip run in the command Line
```
python -m ensurepip -- default-pip
``` 
to upgrade it 
```
python -m pip install -- upgrade pip setuptools wheel
```
to upgrade Python
```
pip install python -- upgrade
```

### Viewing the Jupyter Notebook

In order to better view and work on the jupyter Notebook I encourage you to use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) . You can simply copy and paste the link to this website and you will be able to edit it without any problem.

### Data

The NumPy Project does not require any external dataset . However the Pandas one does require the Stock data in order to work. Stock data are already provided in the Folder data in the form of .csv files, but feel free to use any other data you wish by doing the appropraite modifications.
